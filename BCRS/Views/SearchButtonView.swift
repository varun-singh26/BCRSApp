struct SearchButtonView: View {
    @Binding var showFullScreenCover: Bool //need to pass showFullScreenCover as a @Binding var so the child view, SearchButtonView, can modify the value in the parent view
        //@Binding needed because child view modifies the parent's (HomeView) state (via changing this variable), without owning the state of the variable. A TWO-way connection is established with @Binding
        //If the child used its own @State instead of @Binding, any updates would be local to the child and wouldnâ€™t affect the parent.
